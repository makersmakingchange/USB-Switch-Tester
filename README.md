## How to Obtain a USB Switch Tester
### 1. Do it Yourself (DIY) or Do it Together (DIT)

This is an open-source assistive technology, so anyone is free to build it. All of the files and instructions required to build the USB Swtich Tester are contained within this repository. Refer to the Maker Checklist below.

### 2. Request a build of this device

If you would like to obtain a USB Switch Tester , you may submit a build request through the [MMC Library Page](https://makersmakingchange.com/project/USB-Switch-Tester/). The requestor is responsible for the cost of materials and any shipping.

### 3. How to build this device for someone else

If you have the skills and equipment to build this device, and would like to donate your time to create the switch for someone who needs it, visit the [MMC Maker Wanted](https://makersmakingchange.com/maker-wanted/) section.


## Getting Started

### 1. Read the Makers Checklist

The Makers Checklist contains a list of tasks to complete to build the device.

### 2. Order the Off-The-Shelf Components

The [Bill of Materials](/Documentation/USB_Switch_Tester_BOM_v1.0.xlsx) lists all of the parts and components required to build the USB Switch Tester. The main switch component needs to be ordered online. The rest of the off-the-shelf components are also online or may be available in smaller quantities at your local hardware store or dollar store.


### 3. Print the 3D Printable components

Print the top and bottom components of the case of the device. 

All of the files and individual print files can be in the [/Build_Files/3D_Printing_Files](/Build_Files/3D_Printing_Files/) folder.

### 4. Assemble the USB Switch Tester

Reference the [Assembly Guide](/Documentation/USB_Switch_Tester_Assembly_Guide_v1.0.pdf) for the tools and steps required to build each portion.
